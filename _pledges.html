    <h3> Information for Prospective Pledges </h3>
    <div>
      <p> The national headquarters of Eta Kappa Nu requires that undergraduate pledges be in the top 25% of their class during their junior year or in the top 33% of their class during their senior year. Psi Chapter requires that undergraduate
        pledges have completed either EE312 or EE313 and are enrolled in the other during their pledge semester. In addition, Psi Chapter invites all graduate students who have completed at least one semester of graduate school to pledge. During the
        pledge process, prospective members are required to participate in various service and social activities to encourage pledges to network with peers, faculty, and people in industry.
