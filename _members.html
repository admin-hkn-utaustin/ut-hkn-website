            <p>
              The national headquarters of Eta Kappa Nu requires that pledges be in the top
              25% of their class during their junior year or in the top 33% of their class
              during their senior year. In addition, Psi Chapter requires that pledges be in
              major sequence during their pledge semester. During the pledge process, prospective
              members are required to participate in various service and social activities to
              encourage pledges to network with peers, faculty, and people in industry.
