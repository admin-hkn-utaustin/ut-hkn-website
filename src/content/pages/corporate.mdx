## About Eta Kappa Nu

Eta Kappa Nu strives to be a platform for recognizing outstanding Electrical and Computer Engineering students in the UT Austin ECE department. Our members are selected from the top 25% of their junior class and the top 33% of their senior class, showcasing their exceptional academic achievements. We extend our services to the department and the community through participation in multi-discipline extra-curricular programs throughout the semester. These programs offer community and leadership experiences to our members. We also organize several social events such as Fireside Chats, Signature Party, and Smoker, which provide great opportunities for our pledges to freely mingle with HKN members, ECE faculty, and corporate representatives.

If you are interested in becoming a corporate supporter of HKN, please see our [corporate packet](../resources/corporate_packet_spring_2024.pdf) and email our Corporate Relations Representative. Companies with less than 500 employees can contact our Corporate Relations Representative for adjusted pricing.
