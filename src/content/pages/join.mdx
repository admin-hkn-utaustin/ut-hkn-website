The national headquarters of Eta Kappa Nu requires that pledges be in the top 20% of their class if they are a sophomore by credit hours (30+), top 25% of their class if they are a junior by credit hours (60+), or in the top 33% of their class if they are a senior by credit hours (90+). In addition, the Psi Chapter requires pledges to have completed one of ECE 312 or ECE 411 prior to pledging, as well as to be enrolled in or have completed the other course in the semester that they pledge. If you fulfill these requirements, you will receive an email inviting you to undergo a semester-long pledge process. In addition, all graduate students in the ECE department who have completed one semester will be invited and are welcome to pledge.

These requirements are a general guidance for how much you should be involved in HKN. We will be flexible if you cannot meet any of the requirements, within reason, as long as we feel as if you have put in effort towards joining the organization. If you have any questions about the pledge process, please [contact the recording secretary](mailto:recording@utexashkn.org).

#### Signature Book

##### Required signatures

- Interview **five** pledges
- Interview **tbd** actives
- Interview **all** officers

##### Suggested Interview Questions

- What's your favorite thing about HKN?
- What's your tech core (if you've decided on one)?
- What's your favorite ECE course?
  Get creative! The goal of the sig book is to help you get to know your peers in HKN.

##### Guidelines

- The design of the signature book is up to you. It does not need to be in book form.
- Your name should be prominently located on your signature book.
- Be friendly when asking for an interview.

At the end-of-semester banquet/smoker, an award will be given for the best sig book.
