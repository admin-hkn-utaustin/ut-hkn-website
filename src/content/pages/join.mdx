The national headquarters of Eta Kappa Nu requires that pledges be in the top 25% of their class if they are a junior by credit hours (60+), or in the top 33% of their class if they are a senior by credit hours (90+). In addition, the Psi Chapter recommends that pledges have completed both ECE 312 and ECE 313 by the end of their pledging semester so that all HKN members have an idea of what tech core they want to pursue. If you fulfill these requirements, you will receive an email inviting you to undergo a semester-long pledge process. In addition, all graduate students in the ECE department who have completed one semester will be invited and are welcome to pledge.

These requirements are a general guidance for how much you should be involved in HKN. We will be flexible if you cannot meet any of the requirements, within reason, as long as we feel as if you have put in effort towards joining the organization. If you have any questions about the pledge process, please [contact the recording secretary](mailto:recording@utexashkn.org).

#### Signature Book

##### Required signatures

- Interview **five** pledges
- Interview **tbd** actives
- Interview **all** officers

##### Suggested Interview Questions

- What's your favorite thing about HKN?
- What's your tech core (if you've decided on one)?
- What's your favorite ECE course?
  Get creative! The goal of the sig book is to help you get to know your peers in HKN.

##### Guidelines

- The design of the signature book is up to you. It does not need to be in book form.
- Your name should be prominently located on your signature book.
- Be friendly when asking for an interview.

At the end-of-semester banquet, an award will be given for the best sig book.
