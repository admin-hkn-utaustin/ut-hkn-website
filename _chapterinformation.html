        <p>Eta Kappa Nu is a unique membership organization dedicated to encouraging
          and recognizing excellence in the electrical and computer engineering
          fields. Members consist of students, alumni, and other professionals who
          have demonstrated exceptional academic and professional accomplishments.
          Student members are selected on the basis of scholastic standing, character,
          and leadership. Through a variety of service programs and leadership
          training, student members develop lifelong skills that earmark them for
          prominent positions in industry and academia. Members are much better
          prepared for the post-college world and are especially valuable and
          attractive to employers. They are recognized as extremely capable, both
          technically and professionally.</p>

      <p>Eta Kappa Nu (HKN), Psi Chapter, is the Electrical and Computer Engineering Honor Society at the
        University of Texas at Austin. We provide a venue for upper-division ECE honor students to meet
        each other, interact with the corporate world, and serve the Department, the University, and the
        community. Like all chapters of HKN, we are dedicated to encouraging and recognizing excellence
        in the fields of Electrical and Computer Engineering. In addition to community-building social
        events and external service events, we host host Technical Core Night, where professors discuss
        each of the technical cores available to students. We also host Peer Advising Night, where HKN
        members advise underclassmen. </p>
