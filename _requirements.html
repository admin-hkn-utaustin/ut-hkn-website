      <li>Your name should be prominently located on your signature book.</li>
      <li>Be professional when asking for faculty or staff signatures (i.e. no scraps of paper). Introduce yourself!</li>
      <li>DO NOT WAIT UNTIL THE LAST MOMENT TO BEGIN COLLECTING SIGNATURES.</li>
      <li>A complete signature book (excluding the President's signature) is to be turned in at Smoker.</li>
      <li>You can get the President's signature <b>only</b> at Smoker.</li>
      <li>At the end-of-semester banquet, an award will be given for the best sig book.</li>
