    <p>Eta Kappa Nu strives to be a platform for recognizing outstanding Electrical
      and Computer Engineering students in the UT Austin ECE department. We extend our
      services to the department and the community through participation in
      multi-discipline extra-curricular programs throughout the semester. These
      programs offer community and leadership experiences to our members. We also
      organize several social events such as Pizzaramas, Signature Party, and Lake
      Party, which provide great opportunities for our pledges to freely mingle with
      HKN members, ECE faculty, and corporate representatives.
